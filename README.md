# Cryptography-and-Its-Basic-Techniques

There are many techniques of cryptography but in this assignment and in my program I have discussed 4 techniques.
1.	Ceaser Cipher.
2.	Shift Cipher
3.	Affine Cipher
4.	RSA Cryptography
For these techniques I have also included GCD and Bezoutâ€™s Coefficient in my program because they are used in some techniques.
